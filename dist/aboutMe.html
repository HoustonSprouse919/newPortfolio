            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Nice to meet you, my name is Tyler Sprouse but I go by Houston. I'm a web developer and designer from Charlotte NC. I've worked jobs from retail to full on research and design.
              <br><br>
                I'm passionate about weightlifting, anime, nature, creating art, gaming, 3d modeling, and creating / finding cool and original websites.
                <br><br>
                I'm always ready to learn more about development and work with great people while doing so!</p>
